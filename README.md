# hsv_color_detection

In this script I use OpenCV library to detect objects on video using colors in the HSV color space. 

After start of script it is possible to pick color to track with mouse cursor. With picked color
the proper mask is applied on the frames of video.

Then it is possible to find contour of object and draw suitable rectangle.
